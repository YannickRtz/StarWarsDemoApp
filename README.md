# Star Wars SwiftUI Demo App

## Description

Thank you for reviewing my coding challenge. It was fun for me to play around with the Star Wars API and SwiftUI, although I did not get as much done, within the given time constraints, as I was initially planning to. This was simply due to me not yet being familiar enough with some of the concepts of SwiftUI. For this reason, the second feature tab of the app is empty.

Obviously this app is also missing many other aspects of a "real" app project, like localization, testing, proper UI design, just to name a few. But I still hope that I was able to demonstrate my ideas about how to write a well structured mobile app, as well as my ability to quickly dive into a new declarative UI framework like SwiftUI (coming from Flutter).

I am looking forward to discussing further questions about this project in an technical interview.
